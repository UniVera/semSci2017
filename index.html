		<p>
		  In the past few years, a push for open reproducible research has led to a proliferation of community efforts for publishing raw research objects like datasets, software, methodologies, etc. These efforts underpin research outcomes much more explicitly accessible. However, the actual time and effort required to achieve this new form of scientific communication remains a key barrier to reproducibility. Furthermore, scientific experiments are becoming increasingly complex, and ensuring that research outcomes become understandable, interpretable, reusable and reproducible is still a challenge.
		 </p> <p>
		  The goal of this workshop is to incentivise practical solutions and fundamental thinking to bridge the gap between existing scientific communication methods and the vision of an reproducible and accountable open science. Semantic Web technologies provide a promising means for achieving this goal, enabling more transparent and well-defined descriptions for all scientific objects required for this new form of science and communication. We are particularly interested in four kinds of contributions: 
		  </p>
		  <ol>
		  <li> Novel approaches that analyze scientific publications to understand how they link to their methods and research outputs</li>
		  <li> Novel approaches that use the research outputs of a scientific publication to facilitate its understanding and reuse (like by generating explanations of results,  interactive visualizations or properly linked datasets and methods)</li><li> 
		  Novel approaches that help comparing and relating software, datasets and methods used in different publications</li>
		  <li> Novel approaches to apply Semantic Web and Linked Data techniques to scientific workflows.
		<p>
		<br/>
		This workshop will be co-located with <strong><a href="https://iswc2017.semanticweb.org">ISWC2017</a></strong>

<h4  class="blue"> Submission Guidelines</h4>
<p>SemSci2017 will combine paper and demo presentations with break-out sessions. Accepted papers will be published at CEUR workshop series. SemSci2017 explicitly welcomes alternative and enhanced submission formats such as communicative online materials. Authors who are preparing such a submission should contact the workshop organizers in advance to make sure we can accommodate for them in the submission and review process.
</p> <p>
In addition to regular research papers, we will also invite short papers of up to 4 pages on tools and demos. Participants presenting such a paper will be expected to demonstrate the tool in the context of Semantic Science. We look both for innovative software solutions as well as tool that have proven useful in enabling Open Semantic Science. Papers will be reviewed based on potential impact of the tool for Open Semantic Science, usability, and documentation.
</p><p>
Workshop participants will be expected to contribute informally to discussions as well as bring up their own topics of interest. In addition, we expect to have break-out sessions to identify and discuss new topics and their related challenges.</p>

<p>
<strong>To be announced: participants may send submissions in new formats.</strong>. Also, posters will be accepted.
